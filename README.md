# Progressive Growing CYCLE GAN

###  P1: Introduction
• In this project, the goal is to integrates CycleGAN with Progressive Growing
GAN to achieve high-resolution image-to-image translation using unpaired
datasets.<br>
• By progressively increasing image resolution during training, this model
enhances stability and image quality, beginning with low-resolution images and
gradually adding layers as training advances.<br>
• Potential tasks include translating between different seasons (e.g., summer to
winter) or styles (e.g., artwork to photo realism).<br>
• The model's performance will be compared against a standard CycleGAN,
focusing on improvements in image quality and training stability.
